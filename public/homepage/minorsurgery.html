        Minor surgery, as offered by the clinic, falls under the general
        category of surgical care, which focuses on diagnosing and treating
        diseases, injuries, and deformities through operative techniques.

      <h2 class="section-title">General Definition of Minor Surgery</h2>
      <img src="../assets/images/minorsurgery1.jpg" alt="Heart monitoring" />
      <p>
        Minor surgery is characterized by its low risk of complications, being
        minimally invasive (avoiding the opening of major body cavities),
        reliance on local anesthesia or minimal sedation, and being performed on
        an outpatient basis (allowing the patient to return home the same day),
        resulting in a quick recovery and reduced scarring.
