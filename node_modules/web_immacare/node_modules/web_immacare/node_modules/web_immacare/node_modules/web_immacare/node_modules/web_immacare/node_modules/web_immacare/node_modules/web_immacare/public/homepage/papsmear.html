      <p>
        The Pap smear (or Pap test) is a crucial screening tool for women's
        reproductive health, primarily focused on preventing cervical cancer.

      <h2 class="section-title">Pap Smear (Papanicolaou Test)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Pap Smear (or Pap test) is a quick, painless screening procedure in
          which a healthcare provider collects cells from the cervix (the lower,
          narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina) to be examined
          under a microscope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Purpose: The primary goal is to screen for precancerous and cancerous
          cell changes on the cervix. By detecting these changes early, they can
          be treated before cancer develops.
        </li>
        <li>
          Procedure: During a pelvic exam, an instrument called a speculum is
          inserted into the vagina to hold the walls open. A small brush or
          spatula is then used to gently collect a sample of cells from the
          surface of the cervix and the cervical canal. The sample is sent to a
          lab for analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Co-Testing: The Pap smear is often performed alongside an HPV test
          (Human Papillomavirus test), which checks for the presence of
          high-risk strains of the HPV virus—the main cause of cervical cancer.
          This combination is called co-testing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        A Pap smear result can be classified as Normal/Negative (no abnormal
        cells found) or Abnormal/Positive (cell changes detected). The most
        common abnormal findings relate to the changes caused by the Human
        Papillomavirus (HPV).

      <h2 class="section-title">Symptoms and Why Screening is Critical</h2>
      <p>
        Pap smear screening is critical and life-saving because precancerous
        cell changes usually cause NO symptoms. Symptoms like abnormal vaginal
        bleeding, unusual discharge, and pelvic pain are associated with
        advanced cervical cancer, which screening aims to prevent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you experience any of these symptoms, it is crucial to consult a
        healthcare provider immediately, even if you are up-to-date on your Pap
        smears.
