        Ear Piercing is a common cosmetic procedure involving the puncture of
        the earlobe or cartilage to allow the insertion of jewelry.

      <ul>
        <li>Infection</li>
        <li>Allergic Reaction</li>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Keloid:</strong> An overgrowth of scar tissue that appears as a
        firm, raised, often pink or flesh-colored lump. While not dangerous,
        keloids may require dermatological treatment, such as steroid injections
        or laser therapy, to shrink or remove.

        In addition its a primarily form of personal expression and adornment,
        it is a minor surgical procedure that carries specific medical
        considerations, making the choice of method and aftercare crucial for a
        safe outcome.

      <h2 class="section-title">Aftercare Tips</h2>
      <p>
        Aftercare requires strict adherence to hygiene to ensure safe healing.
        Avoid using harsh chemicals like alcohol or hydrogen peroxide to prevent
        irritation and complications. Do not remove the initial, hypoallergenic
        jewelry until the piercing is fully healed.
